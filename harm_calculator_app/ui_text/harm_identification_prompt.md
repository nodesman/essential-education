## Analyzing Harm: A Grading Framework

When you analyze an incident, it's helpful to grade the severity of the harm caused by each individual. Use the following system to bring clarity to the situation. Consider the **severity, pervasiveness, duration, and impact** of their behavior.

---

### **Grade F: Complete Failure / Severe and Pervasive Harm**

*   **Use this for:** Individuals who are the primary architects of foundational trauma or have caused catastrophic, life-altering harm.
*   **Severity:** Extreme (e.g., severe physical, emotional, psychological abuse).
*   **Pervasiveness:** Harm is present in nearly all interactions.
*   **Duration:** Often long-term, spanning years or decades.
*   **Impact:** Life-altering, causing deep-seated somatic and psychological wounds.
*   **Reasoning:** The behavior represents a complete failure to meet the most basic standards of human decency or role-specific responsibility (e.g., parent, guardian, leader).

---

### **Grade D: Significant Failure / Serious and Consistent Harm**

*   **Use this for:** Individuals who exhibit a consistent pattern of serious harm, emotional neglect, invalidation, or active participation in harmful events.
*   **Severity:** High. The emotional betrayal, cruelty, or neglect is severe.
*   **Pervasiveness:** Harmful patterns are consistent and predictable.
*   **Duration:** Often long-term.
*   **Impact:** Profoundly damaging to trust, solidarity, and self-worth. They actively add to trauma instead of helping to bear it.
*   **Reasoning:** Represents a significant failure in moral or relational responsibility.

### **Grade C: Clear Failure / Significant and Contextual Harm**

*   **Use this for:** Individuals whose harm, while severe, is primarily contained within a specific context (e.g., workplace, a particular project or timeframe).
*   **Severity:** High within its context (e.g., abuse of power, manipulation, bullying).
*   **Pervasiveness:** Pervasive *within the specific context*.
*   **Duration:** Limited to the duration of the context.
*   **Impact:** Can cause acute, severe trauma, burnout, and disruption (e.g., to a career or social life).
*   **Reasoning:** A clear failure of role-specific responsibility (e.g., leadership, professional ethics).

### **Grade C- / D+: Borderline Failure / Significant Contributing Harm**

*   **Use this for:** Individuals who act as significant contributors to a harmful situation but may be operating as secondary agents, enabled by a more powerful individual. This grade can also apply to those whose failure to act causes significant harm, but whose culpability may be mitigated by circumstances (e.g., their own victimhood or powerlessness).
*   **Severity:** Moderate to High.
*   **Pervasiveness:** Pervasive *within their sphere of influence*.
*   **Duration:** Limited to the context.
*   **Impact:** A significant contributor to a toxic environment and distress.
*   **Reasoning:** A serious bad actor, but their ability to cause harm may be dependent on another's power or protection. Alternatively, their failure to protect is a significant issue, but mitigating factors reduce their direct culpability.
