#### **Chapter X: The Litmus Test: Diagnosing Your New Organization's Mental Model**

In your first 90 days, your most critical task is to diagnose the dominant mental model of the organization and its key leaders. This knowledge will dictate your strategy for survival, success, and integration.

**1. The Inherited-Static Organization ("The Bureaucracy")**

*   **Motto:** "We've always done it this way."
*   **Diagnosis:** Power lies in established processes and formal titles. Change is viewed as a threat.
*   **Your Strategy:** First, learn the rules and processes perfectly. Demonstrate that you are a master of the existing system. Frame any suggestion for change as a way to more perfectly fulfill the original, stated mission. Do not challenge the hierarchy.

**2. The Inherited-Dynamic Organization ("The Institution")**

*   **Motto:** "We honor our traditions while embracing the future."
*   **Diagnosis:** Power lies with those who can skillfully balance the old and the new. The organization's identity is important.
*   **Your Strategy:** Frame your new ideas as the next logical evolution of the company's core values. Show deep respect for the history and culture before suggesting changes. Use the language of "both/and" rather than "either/or."

**3. The Derived-Static Organization ("The Founder's Dogma")**

*   **Motto:** "Our unique process is the key to our success."
*   **Diagnosis:** This is often a once-innovative company now rigidly attached to the founder's original vision. The process that brought success is now a sacred, unchangeable text.
*   **Your Strategy:** Do not challenge the dogma directly. Instead, demonstrate how your ideas and actions are the purest expression of the founder's original intent. Your goal is to be seen as the most loyal disciple of the core vision.

**4. The Derived-Dynamic Organization ("The Lab")**

*   **Motto:** "The best idea wins, period."
*   **Diagnosis:** The organization is in a constant state of flux. Power is informal and flows to those with the most compelling data and results.
*   **Your Strategy:** Come prepared. Bring data, not opinions. Be ready to have your ideas rigorously challenged and to abandon them if they are proven wrong. Show your loyalty to results, not to a specific method.
