#### **Chapter X: Decoding Your Colleagues: Managing Relationships Using the Four Models**

Your effectiveness at work depends on your ability to influence and persuade others. The key is to understand their operating model and adapt your communication style accordingly. This is especially critical when managing your relationship with your boss.

**Managing the Inherited-Static Boss (The "By-the-Book" Manager)**

*   **Their Behavior:** They manage by enforcing existing company policies and directives from their own superiors. They dislike ambiguity and prioritize process over results.
*   **Your Strategy:** Provide them with certainty. Communicate in terms of process and policy. When you propose an action, explicitly state which rule or directive it complies with. To get approval for something new, find an existing rule you can interpret in your favor.

**Managing the Inherited-Dynamic Boss (The "Company Man/Woman")**

*   **Their Behavior:** They are politically savvy and focused on the health of the institution. They want to look good to their superiors and avoid rocking the boat unnecessarily.
*   **Your Strategy:** Frame your requests in terms of how they will benefit the team, the department, and the company's reputation. Show how your work aligns with the organization's stated goals. Assure them that you have considered the political implications of your actions.

**Managing the Derived-Static Boss (The "My-Way-or-the-Highway" Manager)**

*   **Their Behavior:** They have a rigid set of personal rules for how work should be done, which may or may not align with company policy. They are often micromanagers.
*   **Your Strategy:** Your first job is to learn their personal rulebook. In the short term, follow it to the letter to build trust. When you must deviate, frame it as an experiment to achieve *their* stated goals more effectively. Never challenge their core premises directly.

**Managing the Derived-Dynamic Boss (The "Problem-Solver")**

*   **Their Behavior:** They are focused on outcomes and are open to any method that works. They are impatient with bureaucracy and process for its own sake.
*   **Your Strategy:** Bring them solutions, not problems. Be concise. Lead with the data and the expected outcome. Be prepared for them to challenge your assumptions and change direction quickly.
