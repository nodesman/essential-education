Strategy is the art of prediction. All successful plans are based on an accurate prediction of how other people and systems will react to your actions. The Four Models framework is a powerful tool for developing this predictive capability.

Before taking any significant action—whether in a negotiation, a conflict, or a business venture—run your key players through this diagnostic:

**1. If you are dealing with an Inherited-Static system...**

*   **Prediction:** The system will resist any novel action. It will respond by citing rules and precedent. Its behavior is highly predictable but also highly inflexible.
*   **Strategic Application:** Do not expect to persuade. Your strategy must either work entirely within the existing rules or have enough power to make the rules irrelevant. Find the loopholes.

**2. If you are dealing with an Inherited-Dynamic system...**

*   **Prediction:** The system will try to absorb your action by re-interpreting it to fit the existing tradition. It will seek compromise and co-opt your language.
*   **Strategic Application:** Your strategy must be resistant to co-optation. Be firm on your core principles and definitions. Be prepared for a long negotiation where the meaning of terms is the primary battlefield.

**3. If you are dealing with a Derived-Static system...**

*   **Prediction:** The system will view any action that contradicts its core dogma as an existential threat. It will respond with disproportionate aggression and will not be swayed by facts.
*   **Strategic Application:** Avoid direct, logical confrontation. Your strategy should focus on containment, building alliances with other players, and demonstrating the negative consequences of the system's rigidity to a wider audience.

**4. If you are dealing with a Derived-Dynamic system...**

*   **Prediction:** The system will react to your action based on the data and results it produces. It is open to being persuaded if you can prove your case.
*   **Strategic Application:** Your strategy can be direct and transparent. The core of your plan should be a well-designed experiment with clear metrics. The best argument is a successful outcome.

By diagnosing the models of the actors involved, you move from hopeful guessing to calculated strategy. You can anticipate their reactions, prepare your counter-moves, and choose the course of action most likely to succeed.
