# Project: [Your Project Title - e.g., Clarity Writings]

## Purpose

This repository serves as the central hub for developing a series of books and related content focused on understanding complex human behaviors and strategic thinking. Key themes include identifying harm, analyzing strategic actions (like the role of money and risk), and promoting clarity in understanding real-world situations.
The motivation for focusing on harmful people and behaviors stems from recognizing that harm exists on a wide spectrum, far beyond easily identifiable criminal acts. There's a vast space of destructive actions that can lead to severe, irreparable consequences – including loss of life, devastation to one's family, or permanent financial ruin that eliminates future opportunities – yet some of these actions might operate within legal or even socially accepted boundaries. Understanding this spectrum and learning to identify potentially harmful individuals and their tactics is therefore crucial for self-preservation, well-being, and navigating life effectively.
The primary goal is to provide a structured yet flexible environment to capture disparate thoughts and gradually refine them into coherent written works. This process itself is intended as an act of clarification, translating lived experience and insights into understandable lessons for others. Ultimately, the aim is to equip readers with the vocabulary and conceptual understanding to identify problematic behaviors and navigate life more strategically, contributing to a world where unethical actions are less likely to succeed.

## Directory Structure

*   `/`: Root directory. Contains this README.
*   `books/`: Houses individual book projects.
    *   `harmful_people/`: Content related to the book on identifying and understanding harmful individuals and behaviors.
    *   `strategic_actions/`: Content related to the book on strategic thinking, including concepts like money, risk, and recognizing strategic moves.
    *   `power/`: Content defining and exploring power as the fundamental ability to act, impact, or cause change.
    *   `empathy/`: Content exploring the nuances of empathy: what it is, what it isn't, its application, importance, and limitations.
    *   `relationships/`: Content focused on understanding and navigating various types of relationships.
    *   `(other_books...)/`: Placeholder for future book projects.
    *   Each book directory may contain an `outline.md` file for planning and Markdown files for chapters/sections as they develop.
*   `rough_notes/`: The **primary capture area** for all raw, unfiltered ideas, notes, anecdotes, and concepts as they arise.

## Key Cross-Cutting Themes

Certain concepts are expected to appear across multiple books. A significant example is **Boundaries** – understanding what they are, how to set them, why they are important (and contexts where they might seem less important), and how they relate to harmful interactions, strategic living, empathy, and relationships. Initial thoughts on Boundaries will be captured in `rough_notes/` and tagged for potential integration into various works or potentially forming the basis of a dedicated book later.

## Workflow: Capturing and Refining Ideas

1.  **Capture Raw Thoughts:** Whenever an idea strikes, create a **new Markdown file** in the `rough_notes/` directory.
    *   Use a clear naming convention, like `YYYY-MM-DD_brief_topic.md` (e.g., `2023-10-27_idea_about_financial_leverage.md`).
    *   **Mark notes clearly:** Start the file content with `# ROUGH NOTE: [Brief Topic]` to explicitly state its status.
    *   Write freely. Don't worry about perfection, structure, or where it fits yet. Just get the thought down.

2.  **Tagging for Potential Placement (Optional but Recommended):** Since ideas might apply to multiple books or chapters, add simple tags or notes *within* the rough note file itself. This helps later when sorting.
    *   Example: Near the end of the note, you could add:
        ```
        Potential Placement:
        - [Book: Harmful People] Chapter: Manipulation Tactics
        - [Book: Strategic Actions] Concept: Resource Control
        - [Book: Strategic Actions] Chapter: Money as a Tool
        ```
    *   This allows a single raw idea to be mentally (and later physically) linked to multiple destinations without duplicating it prematurely.

3.  **Review and Process:** Periodically (e.g., weekly), review the files in `rough_notes/`.
    *   **Refine:** Clarify the writing, add detail, or break down complex ideas into smaller notes if needed.
    *   **Relocate:** If a note feels sufficiently developed and clearly belongs in a specific book's chapter or section, *move* or *copy* (and adapt) the content into the relevant Markdown file within the `books/` directory structure. Update or remove the `ROUGH NOTE` marker.
    *   **Outline Development:** Use insights from rough notes to build out the `outline.md` files within each book's directory.

4.  **Develop Book Content:** Focused writing happens within the specific book directories in `books/`. Use the processed notes and outlines as guides.

## Future Goals

The concepts and structured content developed here may eventually form the basis for creating more interactive learning tools, such as an AI/LLM designed to test understanding of nuanced situations described in the books. This underscores the importance of clear definitions and well-articulated concepts as the writing progresses.
