trigger: "You see something ugly. A slur used against a waiter. A subtle act of caste exclusion. A woman silenced or harassed in public."

## The Trigger
The moment is sudden and sharp. It cracks the veneer of "civilized society." You witness a moment of raw feudalism or misogyny—someone asserting dominance based on birth or gender. It feels archaic, yet it is happening right in front of you.

## The Shadow
**The Protective Denial.**
Your mind recoils. It is too painful to accept that this is your reality.
You freeze. You think: *"Did that really happen? Maybe I misunderstood. Maybe he didn't mean it that way."*
This is **Dissociation**. Your brain is trying to "pain-paint" the reality—smoothing over the jagged edges to protect your worldview. You want to believe the world is better than it is, so you gaslight yourself into silence.

## The Pivot
**The Unflinching Witness.**
Stop the denial immediately. Denial is a comfort you cannot afford.
If you close your eyes, you become an accomplice.
A Sovereign Individual looks at the ugliness and calls it by its name.

*   *"That was casteism."*
*   *"That was misogyny."*
*   *"That was abuse."*

Do not emotionalize it yet. First, **factualize** it.
Treat it as a cold splash of water. It wakes you up. It reminds you that the "Jungle" is still here, and your work is not done. The shock is not an error; it is data.

## The Mantra
*"I see it. I name it. I do not look away."*

## The Tactic
**The Internal Log.**
In the moment of shock, force your brain to narrate the facts effectively: *"Person A said X to Person B."*
If it is safe to intervene, you intervene with icy calm (not hysterical anger).
If it is not safe, you remember. You do not let the event dissolve into a "vague bad feeling." You keep the sharp edge of the memory, so you never become complacent.
