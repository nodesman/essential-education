## The Trigger
The transition from sleep to wakefulness. The mind is soft, vulnerable, and unformed. The world is waiting to rush in—notifications, emails, bad news, other people's urgencies.

## The Shadow
**The Reactive Start.**
You grab the phone. Instantly, you are flooded with dopamine and cortisol. You are angry at a politician, jealous of a friend's vacation, or stressed by a boss's email—all before you have even brushed your teeth.
You have surrendered your "Prime Time" to the algorithm. You have started the day on the defensive.

## The Pivot
**Booting the Sovereign OS.**
Treat your mind like a high-security facility. Do not let unauthorized personnel (social media/news) enter until you have completed your security check.

The first 10 minutes are for **Input-Zero**.
1.  **Hydrate:** Start the biological engine.
2.  **Move:** Stretch the animal.
3.  **Stand:** Feel gravity.

Tell yourself: *"I am awake. The world exists, but for these ten minutes, it does not have permission to access me. I am setting the tone, not the feed."*

## The Mantra
*"First I inhabit myself; then I inhabit the world."*

## The Tactic
**The "Phone Foyer" Rule:**
Charge your phone in the living room or hallway, never by the bed. Buy an old-school alarm clock. Force yourself to physically walk out of the bedroom to check the digital world. That 10-second walk is enough to reclaim your will.
