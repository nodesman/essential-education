# Editing Checklist (Series‑Wide)

A repeatable checklist for editing across the book series, with emphasis on logic, facts/history, and overloaded terms.

## Editing Passes
- Structure/logic pass: reverse‑outline each chapter; tie claims to support.
- Fact/source pass: flag and verify all facts, dates, quotes, and numbers.
- Terminology pass: audit overloaded terms; enforce glossary definitions.
- Final polish: clarity, tone, cross‑refs, figures, and metadata.

## Logical Fallacies Check
- For each major claim, note: claim → evidence → warrant (does evidence support the stated scope?).
- Watch for: straw man, false dichotomy, hasty generalization, post hoc, circular reasoning, appeal to authority, ad hominem, composition/division, equivocation.
- Actions: add qualifiers ("in X context…"), include limits/counter‑cases, separate correlation from causation.

## Factual/History Verification
- Flag every date, statistic, proper noun, quote, causal statement, superlative, and comparison.
- Verify with two reputable sources; prefer primary/official records for dates/quotes.
- Record citation/footnote: source, date accessed, page/URL. Reproduce calculations and confirm units/time windows.
- Build a brief timeline for time‑sensitive chapters; confirm sequence and overlaps.

## Overloaded Terms Audit
- Maintain a project glossary: one definition per key term; note allowed synonyms.
- On first use: define. Later uses: ensure same sense or explicitly mark a shift.
- Search each term; for every instance ask: does the glossary sense fit this sentence? If not, replace or rephrase with a more specific term.
- Add disambiguators where helpful (e.g., "moral authority" vs "legal authority").

## Series‑Wide Consistency
- Keep a "series bible": timeline, entities, canonical definitions, and style choices.
- Enforce consistent capitalization, units, acronyms (define once), tense/POV across books.
- Verify cross‑references: chapter/figure/table numbers and link targets.

## Draft Markup Tags (quick triage)
- [CHECK-FACT]: needs verification or citation.
- [RISK-FALLACY]: claim/evidence/warrant mismatch to review.
- [CHECK-TERM]: potential overloaded term; confirm glossary sense.

## Pre‑Publication Spot Checks
- Expert beta readers for domain accuracy; general beta readers for clarity.
- Random citation audit (e.g., 10% end‑to‑end verification).
- Read‑aloud or text‑to‑speech pass for flow and cognitive load.
- Sensitivity/ethics review for lived experiences or sensitive groups.

## Quick Rubric (0–2 per chapter)
- Logic: 0 frequent fallacies; 1 minor; 2 none evident.
- Facts: 0 uncited/incorrect; 1 minor fixes; 2 verified and cited.
- Terms: 0 frequent overload; 1 isolated; 2 consistently precise.
- Consistency: 0 conflicts; 1 few; 2 coherent with series bible.

Gate: publish only if all ≥ 1 and total ≥ 7/8.
