# Book Outline: The First 90 Days: A Strategic Plan for a New Job

**Subtitle:** Applying the Principles of Clarity, Narrative, and Power for Long-Term Success

## Introduction: A Job is Not a Role; It's a System
- **See `introduction.md` for the full text.**
- **Purpose of this Book:** This is not a book about how to write a resume. It is a practical, step-by-step guide to applying the strategic principles from the "Essential Education" series to the critical life event of starting a new job.
- **The Core Premise:** Starting a new job is not a passive act of showing up and doing tasks. It is an active, strategic campaign. Your goal is not just to get the job, but to deliberately establish the conditions for your long-term success, fulfillment, and psychological safety.
- **The Framework:** We will use the classic 30-60-90 day model as our structure, but we will supercharge it with our core concepts, focusing on the "pre-game" analysis that happens even before you accept the offer.

## Part 1: The Due Diligence Phase (Day -30 to Day 0): The Application of Normative Clarity

*This is the most critical phase. The decisions made here will determine your success more than any action you take after you start.*

*   **Chapter 1: Your Mission - To See the Real System.**
    - **See `chapter_1_seeing_the_real_system.md` for the full text.**
    -   The job description is a fantasy. Your mission during the interview process is not just to sell yourself, but to conduct an intelligence-gathering operation.
    -   You are not just applying for a job; you are deciding whether to join a complex human system. Your only chance to see it clearly is from the outside.

*   **Chapter 2: The Normative Clarity Audit.**

            -   "What's the difference between someone who is good in this role and someone who is truly great here?" (Reveals what is truly valued).
            -   "What happens when a project misses its deadline or fails?" (Tests for a culture of blame vs. a culture of learning).
    -   **Auditing Your Principled Norms:** A guided exercise for the reader to define their own non-negotiables. What conditions do *they* need to thrive? (e.g., autonomy, respect, work-life balance).
