# Outline: The Art of Negotiation

## Foundational Concept: Negotiation as Managed Conflict

- **The Core Premise:** All conflict is a form of negotiation. It is not a breakdown of the process, but a continuation of it through different means. Actions taken during a conflict—be it an argument, a business maneuver, or even a war—are tactical moves designed to alter the terms of the negotiation.

- **The Strategic View:** This perspective, echoed in Carl von Clausewitz's assertion that "War is the continuation of policy by other means," compels us to look beyond immediate tactics. It requires analyzing the underlying strategic objectives and the desired end-state of any confrontation.
