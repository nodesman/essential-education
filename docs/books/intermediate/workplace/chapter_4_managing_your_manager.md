# Chapter 4: Managing Your Manager

This chapter reframes the employee-manager relationship, arguing that it is the employee's responsibility to actively "manage up." It provides strategies for proactively setting the agenda, communicating needs, and managing expectations, moving beyond passive or obsequious behavior.

### Proactive Management vs. Obsequiousness

Being a good employee does not mean being a sycophant. This section explores the difference between proactive engagement and deference. Key topics include:
*   Setting the agenda for your 1-on-1s.
*   Presenting solutions, not just problems.
*   Learning to "speak the language" of your manager's priorities.

### Boundaries and Your Rights as an Employee

A healthy managerial relationship is built on mutual respect, which requires clear boundaries. This section details what you have a right to expect from any manager.
*   **The Right to Clarity:** You have a right to clear, unambiguous instructions and expectations.
*   **The Right to Feedback:** You have a right to regular, constructive feedback on your performance.
*   **The Right to Respect for Your Time:** You have a right to have your working hours and personal time respected. This includes reasonable expectations around availability and workload.
