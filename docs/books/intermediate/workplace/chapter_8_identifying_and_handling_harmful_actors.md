# Chapter 8: Identifying and Handling Harmful Actors

This chapter provides a framework for identifying and managing interactions with individuals who cause workplace harm. It distinguishes between intentionally malicious behavior and harm that arises from incompetence, insecurity, or poor management skills. The focus is on analyzing the impact of the behavior, regardless of intent, and providing practical, situation-dependent strategies for mitigation.

## The Anti-Triangulation Protocol

One of the most common forms of manipulation is triangulation, where an individual attempts to influence or destabilize you using vague, second-hand information. This protocol provides a tiered method for shutting down this behavior.

*See Chapter X for the full protocol.*

## Pathology Case Study: The Incompetent & Panicked Manager

A significant source of workplace harm comes not from malicious intent, but from managerial incompetence rooted in psychological fragility and panic. This actor does not have a grand, evil plan; they are reacting to a perceived threat to their ego and security.

### Characteristics:
- **Conflict-Avoidant:** They cannot handle direct, professional confrontation or challenges.
- **Vague & Non-Committal:** They refuse to make clear decisions or give direct orders, leaving you in a state of ambiguity.
- **Personalizes Professionalism:** They perceive requests for clarity, process, or accountability as personal attacks.
- **Irrational Escalation:** When feeling cornered or exposed, they lash out with clumsy, often self-destructive attacks (e.g., a surprise "litany meeting" full of baseless claims).

### Strategic Management: The Professionalism Protocol

With this personality type, traditional conversational boundaries often fail. The most effective defense is a **procedural and documentary boundary**. The goal is not to "fix" the manager, but to make it too risky and difficult for them to execute their panicked attack. 

This protocol has two core components:

**1. Reframe from Personal to Process**

When you have an issue with a colleague that the manager is failing to address (e.g., another IC blocking your work), do not frame it as an interpersonal problem. Frame it as a need for a clear, team-wide process.

- **Weak Approach (Verbal/Personal):** "Buffalo, Snake is blocking my PRs again."
- **Strong Approach (Procedural):** "Buffalo, to reduce friction on the team, can we establish a written-down checklist for what is considered 'in-scope' for a PR review?"

This elevates the issue and forces the manager to make a managerial decision, rather than mediate a personal squabble.

**2. Document All Vague Directives**

This is the most critical step. After any meeting where the manager gives a vague, non-committal response, you must create a paper trail with a follow-up email.

- **Subject:** Following up on our 1-on-1: [Topic]
- **Body:** "Hi [Manager], just to confirm our conversation today. I raised a concern about [the issue]. Your guidance was for me to [their vague advice]. As we discussed, I suggested we [your proposed process solution]. Please let me know if I've misunderstood anything, or if there is a different formal process you would like me to follow."

This simple act of documentation creates an undeniable record of their negligence and robs them of the ability to later misrepresent the situation. You are not being argumentative; you are being professional and seeking clarity. The paper trail proves it.
