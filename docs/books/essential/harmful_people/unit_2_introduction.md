# Unit 2: A Field Guide to High-Harm Individuals

## Introduction: Recognizing the Pattern

In our lives, we encounter a vast spectrum of personalities. Most people operate with a reasonable degree of empathy, reciprocity, and respect. They are capable of forming healthy, mutually beneficial relationships. This guide, however, is not about them.

This unit is a field guide to a specific and dangerous category of person: the **High-Harm Individual.** You may also know them as parasitic or exploitative personalities. These are not merely "difficult" or "annoying" people; they are individuals whose patterns of behavior consistently inflict emotional, psychological, financial, or even physical damage on those around them.

A High-Harm Individual is defined by a consistent pattern of the following core traits:

*   **Extreme Self-Centeredness:** Their needs, wants, and feelings are the only ones that truly matter. The world revolves around them.
*   **Lack of Empathy:** They are unable or unwilling to genuinely perceive or validate the emotional experiences of others. Your pain is an inconvenience; your joy is a threat.
*   **Controlling or Manipulative Behavior:** They use subtle and overt tactics to control your actions, thoughts, and emotions to serve their own agenda.
*   **Disregard for Your Well-Being:** Your safety, happiness, and success are secondary to their convenience and desires.
*   **Refusal to Take Accountability:** They are masters of blame-shifting, denial, and rewriting history. Nothing is ever their fault.

Recognizing these individuals is the most critical step in protecting yourself. The goal is not to diagnose them, but to *detect* their behaviors and understand that these patterns necessitate a different set of engagement rules.

### The Operational Rule: Your Framework for Self-Preservation

Because these individuals do not play by the standard rules of social contract, you cannot treat them as you would a healthy person. Doing so leaves you perpetually vulnerable. Therefore, we will operate by a simple, powerful rule with three core components:

1.  **Be Wary Of Them:** Do not give them your trust easily. Vet them carefully and believe the patterns you see, not the potential you hope for.
2.  **Manage Them:** Interact with them strategically, with strong boundaries and low emotional investment. This is about containment, not connection.
3.  **Do Not Treat Them the Same as Others:** Do not give them the same vulnerability, benefit of the doubt, or emotional access that you would give to a healthy, reciprocal person. This is not a punishment; it is a necessary and logical adaptation to their behavior.

The following chapters will break down each of the five core traits in detail. We will explore what they look like in the real world, what they feel like to be on the receiving end of, and how to apply the operational rule to protect your inner world and reclaim your agency.
