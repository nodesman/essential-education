**Target Book:** `books/relationships/`
**Target File:** `chapter_1_shared_reality.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The chapter clearly defines "shared reality" as the mutual acceptance of objective, verifiable facts.
- [ ] It explains *why* this is the bedrock of trust and communication.
- [ ] It provides clear, simple examples of shared reality (e.g., agreeing it's raining) versus disagreements of interpretation (e.g., whether one *likes* the rain).
- [ ] It contrasts a relationship with shared reality against one without it, setting the stage for later discussions on conflict and manipulation.
