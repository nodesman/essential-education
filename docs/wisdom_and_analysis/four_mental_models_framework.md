# The Four Mental Models Framework

This framework categorizes the primary ways individuals and systems construct and interact with their worldview or "mental model" of reality. The models are defined by two axes: the foundation of the model (Inherited vs. Derived) and its capacity for adaptation (Static vs. Dynamic).

### 1. The Inherited-Static Model (The "Follower")

*   **Foundation:** Inherited. The model is received wholesale from an external authority—culture, religion, family, tradition.
*   **Adaptation:** Static. The model is treated as complete, perfect, and timeless. Adaptation and re-interpretation are seen as corruption or heresy. The goal is to preserve the model in its original, pure form.
*   **Ultimate Loyalty:** To the purity and preservation of the inherited system.
*   **Core Action:** Following the rules.

### 2. The Inherited-Dynamic Model (The "Reformer")

*   **Foundation:** Inherited. The core axioms and identity are taken from an established tradition.
*   **Adaptation:** Dynamic. The model adapts by re-interpreting the core beliefs to fit new circumstances. The rules can be bent to ensure the system survives and remains relevant.
*   **Ultimate Loyalty:** To the survival and relevance of the inherited system.
*   **Core Action:** Re-interpreting the rules.

### 3. The Derived-Static Model (The "Ideologue")

*   **Foundation:** Derived. The model is initially built from first principles, observation, or a reaction against an existing system. It is a new creation.
*   **Adaptation:** Static. After its initial creation, the model freezes and becomes a rigid, non-negotiable dogma. New evidence that contradicts the model is rejected.
*   **Ultimate Loyalty:** To the purity and propagation of the derived ideology.
*   **Core Action:** Enforcing the new rules.

### 4. The Derived-Dynamic Model (The "Interrogator" / "Scientist")

*   **Foundation:** Derived. The model is built from first-principles observation, logic, and a constant stream of incoming data.
*   **Adaptation:** Dynamic. The model is in a constant state of being rebuilt. Any part of the model, including its foundation, can be discarded if new evidence proves it wrong.
*   **Ultimate Loyalty:** To truth, accuracy, and the most effective map of reality, as best as it can be determined.
*   **Core Action:** Questioning all rules, including one's own.
