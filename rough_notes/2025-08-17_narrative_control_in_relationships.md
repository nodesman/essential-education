# Narrative Control in Relationships

When one person in a relationship asserts a point of view that is unfair, distorted, or disconnected from reality, it is a form of narrative warfare. This is an attempt to unilaterally control the shared narrative of the relationship.

This is harmful because:
- It undermines the shared reality that is foundational to a healthy relationship.
- It can be a form of gaslighting, making the other person question their own perceptions and sanity.
- It prevents genuine communication and problem-solving.
- It is a power play designed to dominate, not to connect.

Controlling your own narrative in this context means:
- Refusing to accept a distorted reality.
- Clearly and calmly stating your own perception of events.
- Setting boundaries against unfair accusations or characterizations.
- Recognizing when a conversation is no longer about connection but about control.
