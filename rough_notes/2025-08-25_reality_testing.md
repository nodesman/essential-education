# Reality Testing Beyond Sensory Input

- Reality isn't just what we perceive directly through our senses (sight, sound, etc.). This is a limited, tactical view of reality.
- A fuller, more strategic perception of reality requires active testing and verification.
- Key method: Asking questions and seeking concurrence from trusted, independent sources. This is the social validation of reality.
- This process helps establish a "shared reality," which is the foundation of healthy relationships and functional groups.
- The absence of this testing, or the deliberate distortion of it by others, leads to a breakdown in shared reality. This is a core tactic of manipulation (e.g., gaslighting), where an individual's perception is intentionally undermined.
- Therefore, reality testing is a fundamental skill for navigating complex social environments and defending against manipulation.
