# ROUGH NOTE: Truth Adherence and Strategic Humility

The strategic importance of truth adherence and humility cannot be overstated. The alternative leads to deep insecurity.

If you face a performance issue or a penalty today, it is fine. No one is born perfect, and no one can stop learning. Ethics and laws change, and what is considered right and wrong changes as well. 

The key is to understand from **good faith** why doing something is wrong. If you can achieve this understanding, you can avoid similar problems in the future. Truth and humility are not just virtues; they are protective strategies for long-term stability and growth.
