The act of taking your time to make a prompt is not just an act of saying something but it's also a mental exercise in you constructing a new reality. It is almost like calisthenics. It is an act of forming the future, an act of contributing to our collective effort to take humanity towards the next possible realm, to create new futures by getting into the act of writing new prompts as well as the act of improving and taking a more disciplined approach to writing prompts.

Prompt acumen is a new life skill.
