# On the Failure and Over-Application of Strategic Meaning

**Initial Premise:** "A word can functionally change how interactions will go, either by prescribing what should happen or by describing the property of something. This projects the word into a strategic sense. If a word has a strategic meaning, when would that meaning cease to apply, unless the word itself is used wrong? This raises the question of over-application."

The strategic meaning of a word doesn't just "cease to apply"; rather, its intended effect **fails to manifest** or even backfires. This is not about using a word "wrong" grammatically, but about a failed strategic calculation. Here’s why that happens:

### 1. Context Collapse

The strategic meaning of a word is not inherent *in* the word; it's activated by the **shared context** between the speaker and the listener. When that context is missing or different, the strategic meaning fails.

*   **Example:** In a military command center, the word "execute" has a clear, high-stakes strategic meaning. If you use that same word in a kindergarten class ("Let's execute this art project!"), the strategic meaning doesn't just vanish—it becomes absurd and inappropriate. The word wasn't "wrong," but the context was. This is the essence of **over-application**: applying a word's strategic value in a context that cannot support it.

### 2. Devaluation Through Overuse

Words are like currency. Their strategic value can be inflated away.

*   **Example:** The word "synergy" was once a powerful strategic term in business to signal the creation of value through combination. It has been so overused that it's now often a meaningless buzzword. When a CEO uses it today, the intended strategic meaning ("I have a sophisticated plan for value creation") may fail to land. The actual interpreted meaning might be, "I am using generic business-speak because I lack a concrete plan." The strategic meaning didn't cease; it inverted from a signal of competence to a signal of cliché.

### 3. Lack of Speaker Credibility

The power of a strategic word is heavily dependent on the credibility of the person wielding it.

*   **Example:** The word "promise."
    *   From a person with a long history of keeping their word, "I promise" is a powerful strategic act that creates security and trust.
    *   From a person who consistently breaks their word, "I promise" has a completely different strategic meaning. It is interpreted as a manipulation tactic, a stalling mechanism, or simply empty noise. The word itself isn't wrong, but the speaker lacks the standing to activate its intended strategic power.

The strategic meaning doesn't disappear. It **fails, transforms, or even backfires.** The error is not in the dictionary, but in the strategist's failure to account for context, devaluation, and their own credibility. This is the risk of "over-application"—assuming a word's strategic power is universal and absolute, when it is, in fact, fragile and context-dependent.
