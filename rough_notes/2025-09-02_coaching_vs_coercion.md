# Coaching vs. Coercion: A Heuristic for Evaluating Feedback

A simple heuristic for distinguishing between constructive feedback (coaching) and manipulative communication (coercion):

- **Coaching:** The primary intent is to improve your work, skills, or performance. The feedback is focused on the task and your growth.
- **Coercion:** The primary intent is to manage your behavior for someone else's emotional comfort, convenience, or agenda. The feedback is focused on modifying you to make things easier for them, often without regard for your own needs or growth.
