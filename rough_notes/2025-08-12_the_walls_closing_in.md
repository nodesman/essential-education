# The Walls Closing In: The Normalization of Tragedy

The tragedy of life is often not a single, dramatic event, but the slow, imperceptible closing of walls around us. We fail to see the gradual constriction because of the "everyday normalization of tragedy," where what was once unacceptable becomes the new baseline.

Ruin, whether for a person or a nation, rarely happens overnight. It is a creeping process of decay. One does not wake up one day to find things suddenly horrible; it happens over time, with each small degradation being absorbed into the normal state of affairs. People inside the system often fail to see the walls closing in.

This highlights a critical failure of strategic foresight. A period of life where things are on an upward trajectory is not guaranteed to continue. Without the deliberate effort to look ahead and recognize these slow-moving negative trends, we can blindly walk into a situation of irreversible decline. The core strategic challenge is to develop the awareness to ask: "Are my walls closing in?" and to resist the normalization of ruin before it's too late.
