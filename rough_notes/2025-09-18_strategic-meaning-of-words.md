# On the Strategic and Temporal Meaning of Words

**Initial Premise:** "A lot many words have a meaning that have strategic implications and without attempting to interpret them in strategic and long term or implication in temporal points of time the meaning of words is incomplete."

### 1. Words as Actions, Not Just Labels

A static, dictionary definition of a word is like a single frame from a movie. It's accurate for that instant, but it tells you nothing of the plot. In reality, words are actions. They are tools we use to *do* things:

*   **Commit:** "I promise" creates a future obligation.
*   **Persuade:** "This is an *investment* in your future" frames a cost as a benefit.
*   **Deceive:** "I'm fine" can be a strategic move to avoid a difficult conversation.
*   **Control:** "You're being irrational" is often not a diagnosis but an attempt to invalidate someone's argument or emotional state.

The meaning is found in the *intent* and the *consequence*, both of which are bound by time.

### 2. The Temporal Dimension: When a Word is Said Matters

The meaning of a statement is radically altered by its position in a sequence of events.

*   **"We need to be more disciplined."**
    *   **Said at the start of a project:** It's a strategic alignment, setting expectations for the future.
    *   **Said after a major failure:** It's a critique of past actions.
    *   **Said in response to a success:** It could be a warning against future complacency.

The word "disciplined" is the same, but its function—its true meaning in that context—is entirely different based on the timeline.

### 3. The Strategic Dimension: Words as Moves on a Chessboard

If you view interactions as having stakes (which they always do), then language is the medium of strategy. Every word choice is a move with potential consequences.

*   **Ambiguity vs. Precision:** A lawyer uses precise language to close loopholes. A diplomat uses ambiguous language to leave room for negotiation. Both are strategic choices. A manager who gives vague feedback ("just be more proactive") may be strategically avoiding the discomfort of a direct, actionable critique, thereby maintaining a power imbalance.
*   **Agency and Framing:** Compare "I had to let him go" with "I decided to let him go." The first abdicates responsibility, framing the action as externally forced. The second claims agency. This choice of words is a strategic move to manage one's own narrative and perceived role in an event.
*   **Connecting to the Books:** This is exactly what the books in this project explore:
    *   **`harmful_people`:** They are masters of using words strategically over time to erode your sense of reality (gaslighting). The meaning of their "I love you" or "I'm sorry" is not in the words themselves, but in the pattern of their actions over time.
    *   **`narrative_control`:** This is the conscious art of choosing your words to define yourself, your past, and your future before someone else does it for you.
    *   **`diplomacy`:** This is the positive application of this principle—using language with a full understanding of its temporal and strategic impact to build alliances and de-escalate conflict.

To truly understand language is to graduate from being a dictionary-reader to being a strategist. It's about asking not just "What does this word mean?" but **"What is this word *doing* right now, and what does it want from the future?"**
