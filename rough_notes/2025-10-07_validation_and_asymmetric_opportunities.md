# The Power of Validation and Asymmetric Opportunities

The power of validation as a mental phenomenon is that it gives you the confidence to act on something that would benefit you immensely.

There are opportunities in the world today where a billion-dollar corporation and a single person in a corner of the world have the same power of impact when executed correctly. While it is not always possible, there are situations where a single developer can out-execute and out-maneuver a billion-dollar corporation and have a greater impact.

While the power of validation to inspire action is undeniable, it's a double-edged sword. Misplaced validation can lead to overconfidence, causing a person to underestimate the real challenges and risks involved. It can create a dangerous blind spot where the person is acting on flawed assumptions, leading to wasted effort and failure.

The idea that a single person can out-maneuver a billion-dollar corporation is a powerful and appealing narrative, but it often suffers from survivorship bias. For every individual who succeeds against the odds, countless others fail. Corporations have vast resources—capital, talent, distribution networks, and legal power—that a single person cannot match.

The nature of the "impact" is also different. An individual might create a product with a deep impact on a niche market, but a corporation can achieve a much broader, if shallower, impact across a global market. The individual's success often depends on finding a specific, narrow opportunity that the corporation has overlooked or deemed too small to pursue.

So, while your point about individual empowerment is valid, a more nuanced view is that an individual's power lies in their agility and ability to exploit niche opportunities. They can achieve a *disproportionately large* impact relative to their resources, but it is rarely the *same* power of impact as a billion-dollar corporation in a head-to-head competition.
