# Introduction: Before You Begin

Welcome.

The book you are holding is the recommended starting point for the "Essential Education" series. It is short, direct, and designed to be read in a single sitting.

Its purpose is to give you a framework for the journey ahead. Before you dive into the detailed strategies and concepts in the main volumes, this guide will provide the "why," the "how," and the "what" of the entire project.

*   **Part 1: The Premise** will answer the question: "Why is this education essential?"
*   **Part 2: The Method** will answer the question: "How should I use these books and tools?"
*   **Part 3: The Map** will answer the question: "What does this series cover and where should I go next?"

Think of this as the orientation session before you begin a new, more rewarding expedition. Let's get started.
