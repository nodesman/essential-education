# Chapter 2: The Normative Clarity Audit

Now that you have embraced your mission as an intelligence operative, you need a methodology. The Normative Clarity Audit is your systematic framework for investigating a potential employer. It is designed to help you peel back the layers of the organization and understand its true nature.

The audit is structured around the three layers of norms we have discussed: Stated, Prevailing, and Principled. Your goal is to gather data on each, and then to analyze the gap between them.

### Step 1: Auditing the Stated Norms

This is the easiest step. You are simply collecting and analyzing the company's official story.

*   **The Job Description:** What skills and values are emphasized? Is it all about "crushing goals" (suggesting a high-pressure sales culture) or "collaboration and learning" (suggesting a team-oriented environment)?
*   **The Mission and Values Statement:** Read the company's official mission statement. Is it specific and actionable, or is it filled with vague corporate jargon? Vague values are often a sign that they are not taken seriously.
*   **Public Statements:** What do the CEO and other leaders say in interviews, on social media, and in press releases? Does their language feel authentic or like carefully managed PR?

At the end of this step, you should have a clear picture of the story the company *wants* to tell about itself.

### Step 2: Auditing the Prevailing Norms

This is the most challenging and most important part of the audit. You are now trying to uncover the unwritten rules—the reality on the ground.

**Techniques for Intelligence Gathering:**

*   **Informational Interviews:** Find current or, even better, former employees on LinkedIn. Ask for 15 minutes of their time to learn about their experience at the company. Former employees have less reason to hide the truth.
*   **Review Sites:** Read reviews on Glassdoor and other similar sites. Do not focus on any single review, but look for recurring patterns. If ten different reviews mention that "management is chaotic," that is a significant data point.
*   **Strategic Questioning During the Interview:** This is your prime opportunity. The key is to ask questions that force a narrative or an example, not a simple "yes" or "no."

**Key Questions to Ask Your Potential Boss and Teammates:**

1.  **"Can you tell me about a time the team had a major disagreement or a project that went wrong? How was it handled?"**
    *   **What you're listening for:** Do they describe a "blameless post-mortem" where the focus was on fixing the process? Or do they hint that a person was blamed? This is the single best test for psychological safety. If they say, "We don't really disagree here," that is a major red flag.

2.  **"What is the typical career path for someone in this role? What's the difference between someone who is good in this role and someone who is truly great here?"**
    *   **What you're listening for:** This reveals what is truly valued. Do they talk about skills and impact, or do they talk about "being a team player" and "not rocking the boat"? This helps you understand if promotion is based on merit or conformity.

3.  **"What does your relationship with your own boss look like? How do you get feedback, and how often?"**
    *   **What you're listening for:** This reveals the management culture. Does your potential boss seem to have an autonomous, high-trust relationship with their superior? Or do they seem to be under constant pressure and micromanagement? The latter will almost certainly be passed down to you.

### Step 3: Auditing Your Principled Norms

This final step turns the lens inward. You cannot know if a company is a good fit if you have not defined what you are looking for.

Take the time to write down the answers to these questions:

*   **What are my non-negotiables?** What are the absolute red lines that I will not cross? (e.g., "I will not work in a place where people yell," "I will not sacrifice my family time for a job.")
*   **What are the conditions under which I do my best work?** Do I need autonomy or structure? A fast pace or a deliberate one? A collaborative team or the ability to work alone?
*   **What do I want to learn?** What skills do I want to acquire in this next role? Does this company have a clear path to help me do that?

By the end of this audit, you will have three distinct pictures: the company's ideal self (Stated Norms), its probable reality (Prevailing Norms), and your own personal requirements (Principled Norms). In the next chapter, we will discuss how to analyze these pictures and make your final decision.
