# Concept Analysis Template

*Use this template to ensure intellectual rigor when developing a new concept for your work. It acts as a forcing function to apply principles of framing, speech-act theory, and presupposition analysis.*

---

### 1. Concept Name
*The official name for this idea.*

`[e.g., "The Loop of Tolerated Disrespect"]`

### 2. Core Definition (The Declaration)
*Declare, in a single, unambiguous sentence, what this concept IS. This is a speech-act of declaration.*

`[Your definition here]`

### 3. Problem It Solves (The Diagnosis)
*Describe the specific problem, confusion, or situation this concept clarifies for the reader. What pain point does it address?*

`[Your description here]`

### 4. The Dominant Frame
*What frame are we consciously applying? How does this frame shift the reader's perspective in a useful way?*

`[e.g., "This is a systems problem, not a personal failing." or "This is a strategic negotiation, not just a conversation."]`

### 5. Core Presuppositions
*What must the reader (and you) already believe to be true for this concept to be valid? Surface all hidden assumptions.*

`[e.g., "1. Disrespect is a measurable behavior. 2. Behavior patterns, when repeated, create feedback loops. 3. Individuals have agency to change their response to a system."]`

### 6. Antithesis (What It Is Not)
*What is this concept often confused with? Clearly distinguishing it from related but incorrect ideas sharpens the definition.*

`[e.g., "This is not the same as 'having a bad day' or a one-off conflict. It is also not 'being too sensitive.' It is a recurring pattern with predictable outcomes."]`

### 7. Real-World Example
*Provide one clear, concise story or example that illustrates the concept in action.*
